0) Welcome page -> start1
1) load a file: the file SA2_4.nodes.csv, for example
2) add some (new) annotations. Remember to refresh the page after this step.
3) annotate all the entities.
4) click 'next' to go continue the annotation or click 'go back to index' when done with the annotation.
5) don't forget to export your annotations. 

For new users, I suggest to play with the example file SA2_4.nodes.csv first.
