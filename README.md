0) Welcome page -> start1
1) Load a file: the file SA2_4.nodes.csv, for example
2) add some (new) annotations. Remember to refresh the page after this step.
3) One can then annotate all the entities.
4) One can either click 'next' to go continue the annotation or click 'go back to index' when done with the annotation.
5) Finally, please export your annotations. 

For new users, I suggest to play with the example file SA2_4.nodes.csv first.

In case of any error or confusion, please report to Shuai Wang at shuai.wang@vu.nl.

Thank you! Good luck!
